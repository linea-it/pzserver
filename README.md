A Python library to access data from the [Photo-z Server](https://pz-server-dev.linea.org.br/). 

The Photo-z Server is an online service based on software developed and delivered as part of the in-kind contribution program BRA-LIN, from LIneA to the Rubin Observatory's LSST. The Photo-z Server is open source and the code is abailable on the Github repository [linea-it/pz-server](https://github.com/linea-it/pzserver_app). 
 
An overview of this and other contributions is available [here](https://linea-it.github.io/pz-lsst-inkind-doc/).
