    "The Photo-z (PZ) Server is an online service available for the LSST Community to host and share lightweight photo-z related data products. The upload and download of data and metadata can be done at the website [pz-server.linea.org.br](https://pz-server.linea.org.br/) (during the development phase, a test environment is available at [pz-server-dev.linea.org.br](https://pz-server-dev.linea.org.br/)). There, you will find two separate pages containing a list of data products each: one for LSST Data Management's oficial data products, and other for user-generated data products. **The registered data products can also be accessed directly from Python code using the PZ Server's data access API, as demonstrated below.**\n",

    "The PZ Server is developed and delivered as part of the in-kind contribution program BRA-LIN, from LIneA to the Rubin Observatory's LSST. The service is hosted in the Brazilian IDAC, not directly connected to the [Rubin Science Platform (RSP)](https://data.lsst.cloud/). However, it requires RSP credentials for user's authentication. For a comprehensive documentation about the PZ Server, please visit the [PZ Server's documentation page](https://linea-it.github.io/pz-lsst-inkind-doc/). There, you will find also an overview of all LIneA's contributions related to Photo-zs. The internal documentation of the API functions is available on the [API's documentation page](https://linea-it.github.io/pz-server-lib/html/index.html).  "

To be considered as a single Spec-z Catalog, the data should be provided as a single file to PZ Server's the upload tool.
